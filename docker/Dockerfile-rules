# "1000" is the documented UID for the "node" user: https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user
# Systems configured to disallow running images as root aren't able to run images that use user name string values for the USER because they can't validate that a named user isn't root.
# To allow this image to run on such systems, use the uid of the user as the value for USER instead of the username.
# See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56503
